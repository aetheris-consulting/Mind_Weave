## Hypnosis Framework Used

MindWeave explicitly uses:

### **Experiential Hypnosis / Tranceplay**

Characteristics:
- Experiences are *lived*, not imagined
- Narrative functions as a state control surface
- Depth is measurable and required
- Consent, framing, and reversibility are mandatory

Supporting techniques include:
- Elman-style induction
- Fractionation
- Catalepsy testing
- Number-forgetting
- Depth stacking (“double it”)
- BEST-ME narrative loops (Belief, Emotion, Sensation, Thought, Motive, Expectation)

This is **not** stage hypnosis, visualization, or suggestion-only meditation.

## What MindWeave Is / Is Not

### MindWeave **IS**
- Tranceplay-class experiential system
- State-gated immersive VR
- Biofeedback-driven
- Facilitator-supervised
- Designed for reproducibility and research

### MindWeave **IS NOT**
- Entertainment VR
- Autonomous therapy
- Medical software
- Psychedelic simulation
- Unsupervised hypnosis

## Hardware Requirements (MVP)

**Required**
- VR Headset: Meta Quest 2 / 3 (PCVR or standalone)
- HR / HRV Sensor: Polar H10 (RR-interval capable)
- Controllers: Standard VR controllers (panic gesture support)

**Optional / Recommended**
- EEG: Muse S or Muse 2 (bandpower only, non-diagnostic)
- PC for facilitator dashboard
- Haptic devices (future work)

---

## Software Components

- VR runtime (Unity or Unreal)
- Biofeedback ingestion layer (HR / HRV / optional EEG)
- Safety Monitor (10 Hz evaluation loop)
- Facilitator Dashboard
- Narrative Engine (BEST-ME cycles)
- Scene Modulation System (pace, color, density, audio)

---

## Safety Model (First-Class Feature)

MindWeave includes **automatic safety intervention**:

- Continuous HR / HRV monitoring
- Caution state → scene softening + facilitator alert
- Hard-pause → neutral grey environment + exit VO
- User-initiated panic gesture or safeword
- Manual facilitator override at all times

The system **assumes some users will go deep** and is designed accordingly.

## Typical Session Flow

1. Screening & informed consent
2. Baseline physiology capture
3. Suggestibility testing
4. Hypnotic induction (non-VR)
5. Depth verification (somnambulism)
6. VR entry
7. Narrative + biofeedback loop
8. Safe exit
9. Post-session debrief & logging

---

## Ethics & Responsibility

- Human-in-the-loop is mandatory
- No unsupervised deployment
- No medical or therapeutic claims
- Clear contraindications required
- Participant retains right to stop at any time

MindWeave prioritizes **agency, consent, and reversibility**.

---

## Research Lineage & Validation

MindWeave aligns with and extends:
- Experiential hypnosis / Tranceplay traditions
- Lucid dreaming research
- Biofeedback safety research
- Human-computer interaction in altered states
