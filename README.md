### A Tranceplay-Class, Biofeedback-Driven Immersive VR System

**MindWeave** is an open-source reference architecture for a **fully immersive, hypnotic VR experience** that integrates **experiential hypnosis**, **physiological biofeedback**, and **narrative state control** to safely induce, maintain, and exit altered states of consciousness.

MindWeave is designed as a **human-in-the-loop system** for wellness, performance, and consciousness exploration—not entertainment VR and not autonomous therapy.

## What Problem MindWeave Addresses

Current VR meditation and “psychedelic” experiences:
- Assume waking consciousness
- Overstimulate without state awareness
- Lack real-time safety enforcement
- Treat immersion as visual novelty

**MindWeave inverts this model**:
- The *state* comes first
- VR is entered only after sufficient hypnotic depth
- Experience is internally generated, externally stabilized
- Safety is automatic, continuous, and enforceable

## Core Concept

MindWeave belongs to the same **system class** demonstrated in peer-reviewed research showing **two-way interaction between altered states and virtual systems** (e.g., bidirectional avatar control from lucid dreams).  
The difference: MindWeave operates in **induced somnambulistic trance**, not REM sleep, and adds modern VR, biofeedback, and safety controls.

At its core, MindWeave is a **closed-loop system**:
