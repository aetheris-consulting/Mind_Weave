# MindWeave Facilitator Manual — v1.0 (MVP)

**Mode:** Wellness (stress reduction / performance).  
**Hardware (MVP defaults):** Muse S/2 EEG (bandpowers), Polar H10 RR-interval HRV, Quest/PCVR.  
**Session length:** ~45 minutes.  
**Depth targets:** Enter VR at Somnambulism (Depth Index ≥40). Sichort possible; Esdaile/Zed excluded for MVP.

---

## 1) Pre‑Session Checklist (5 min)

- **Medical/VR screening:** exclude seizures/photosensitivity, active psychosis, uncontrolled cardiac, recent concussion/TBI, acute panic; conditional with clinician: PTSD w/ dissociation, pregnancy.  
- **Consent obtained:** right to stop (safeword **“Pause”**, panic gesture **hold both triggers 2 s**), data handling, optional audio/raw-EEG.  
- **Hardware check:** Polar H10 snug & paired; Muse fitted; controllers charged; headset IPD set.  
- **Baseline capture (4 min):** 2 min eyes‑open + 2 min eyes‑closed while seated and still.

---

## 2) Suggestibility Tests (3 min)

Postural sway, magnetic hands, finger‑catalepsy, optional eye‑catalepsy.  
Score each 0–2 → **Suggestibility Score (0–8)** to choose pacing (fast/standard/slow).

---

## 3) Induction & Deepening (10 min)

**Delivery mode (selected option): HYBRID.**  
- Facilitator reads rapport‑critical lines (tests, eye catalepsy, number‑forgetting).  
- Pre‑recorded VO runs long deepeners (stairs, floors).

### 3.1 Elman‑style Core (facilitator)

> *Focus point… close eyes…*  
> We’ll open and close your eyes three times. Each time you close them, **double** your comfort.
1) Open… close—double. 2) Open… close—double again. 3) Open… close—**double again**.  
> In a moment I’ll lift and let your arm fall. When it lands, you **double** again… *release… drop… double*.  
> Numbers will begin at 100 and may fade … start counting down now—100 … (pause) … if the numbers drift away, let them go and **double** again.

**Eye catalepsy check:** “Try to open—and find they prefer to stay closed.”  
**Number‑forgetting check:** If client stops/loses place → mark pass.

### 3.2 Stairs Deepener (VO; ~2–3 min)

> Ten steps down… each exhale = one step lower. Ten… nine… each number **doubles** relaxation … down to one.

### 3.3 Floors A/B/C Deepener (VO; 60–90 s)

> There’s a deeper level below. We’ll go **three floors**—A… B… C.  
> At **A**, double it now. Try to say “A” and notice it slow.  
> At **B**, double again; try to say “B”.  
> At **C**, double again; try to say “C”—and let go fully.

**Fractionation:** Perform 2 cycles during induction: *lift slightly → re‑settle → deeper*. Confirm with thumb‑twitch or slowed speech.

**Go/No‑go for VR:** Enter when **Depth Index ≥40** *and* number‑forgetting passed. If <40 at 10 min, run Floors booster once; if still <30 at 15–20 min, pivot to relaxation‑only VR and document.

## 4) VR Immersion (18 min total; 2 modules)

**Scene library (MVP):** Rainbow Bands, Ocean Center, Starfield Void, Forest Glade, Time‑Loop Corridor.  
**Default goal→scene mapping:**  
- Anxiety relief → **Ocean Center** (calming blue/green).  
- Focus improvement → **Starfield Void** (spacious clarity).  
- Emotional processing → **Forest Glade** (grounded, safe).  
- Performance & confidence → **Time‑Loop Corridor** (gentle rehearsal).  
- General relaxation/exploration → **Rainbow Bands** (pleasant abstraction).

### 4.1 BEST‑ME delivery (looped micro‑cycles)

Run 6 cycles per 8–9 minute module; 20–30 s per element. Examples below.

**Anxiety Relief (template):**  
Belief: "You believe calm is a skill you already possess and can call up on cue."
Emotion: "A quiet steadiness spreads through the chest, like warm light."
Sensation: "Your shoulders feel loose and heavy; breath flows smoothly and unforced."
Thought: "A simple phrase appears: 'Exhale = soften.' Distractions drift by without catching."
Motive: "You want to practice a two-breath reset whenever tension shows up."
Expectation: "Each practice makes calm arrive faster and last longer."


**Focus Improvement (template):**  
Belief: "You believe sustained focus is natural when one clear target is chosen."
Emotion: "A calm alertness—bright, interested, unhurried—settles behind the eyes."
Sensation: "Forehead and hands feel cool and precise; posture aligns effortlessly."
Thought: "One task lock—'This now'—and supporting steps line up in order."
Motive: "You want to enter a 20–40 minute deep-work block and protect it."
Expectation: "Every session strengthens your ability to re-enter focus within two breaths."


**Modulation rules (automatic):**  
- ↑Alpha (>+1 SD, ≥3 s) & ↓High‑Beta (<−0.5 SD): slow time, warm palette, simplify visuals, soften transients.  
- Opposite pattern: add structure/grounding cues; never strobe.

---

## 5) Dashboard & Depth Index

**Live:** HR, RMSSD (1‑min rolling), Alpha/Theta/Beta graphs, signal quality, stage timer, **Depth Index (0–100)**.  
**Depth Index heuristic:** 40% physiology (alpha ↑, theta/alpha ↑, RMSSD ↑), 60% behavior (catalepsy, number‑forgetting, arm levitation, slowed speech). Manual override allowed.

---

## 6) Safety & Emergency Protocols

**Caution (auto‑soften + alert):** RMSSD ↓ >30% for ≥20 s **or** HR ↑ >25 bpm for ≥15 s.  
**Hard Pause (auto‑pause):** RMSSD ↓ >50% for ≥10 s **or** HR ≥120 bpm for ≥20 s **or** panic gesture/safeword.

**Auto‑pause sequence (system):**  
- **Visual:** fade to neutral soft‑grey horizon room.  
- **Audio VO (≈60–75 s):** “You’re safe. I’m pausing the session now… counting 5→1… back clear and steady.”  
- Mic opens to facilitator; resume only on facilitator command.

**Manual Emergency Exit (facilitator):** stop VR → remove headset if needed → orient to room → water/snack → extended 2‑min count‑up. Escalate if impaired after 10 min.

---

## 7) Post‑Session Debrief (5 min)

- Self‑ratings (0–10): depth, calm, vividness.  
- Short structured reflection: “What felt safest?”, “What worked best?”, “One cue to use this week.”  
- Log outcomes & notes into **Memory Shard**.

---

## 8) Documentation & Privacy

- Shard stored locally (encrypted). Raw EEG optional; RR intervals + bandpowers default.  
- Retention: raw 12 mo; summaries until deletion. One‑click purge on request.
